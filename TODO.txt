- Fix eman-dev builds, cmake's newly used FindPython3(): need to make conda-build add PYTHON env var, solution: add python to host reqs
- Fix binary builds to actually build, not test (in renamed jenkins, I think)
- Documentation

- SegFault
xubuntu      : src and eman-dev
build machine: no src, binary
blake        : no src, eman-dev (illegal instruction)



- Remove individual deps from an eman-deps env
conda is broken, nothing we can do

ImageDimensionExcept
- exceptions do not dislay on Linux
- pgm, png,
	- imagic
- tiff STACKS
	- big tiff ?


LATEST ??
- upload/publish gui/nogui eman-dev
  - cmake findHDF5 issue

- Currently, nogui ignores tests
  - have cmake not install gui programs into nogui package ???

- binary builds: do not compile on build machines, package eman-dev.
Daily cron or trigger packaging after 1 hour of eman-dev update ?

- what to do with eman2/recipe, it's a duplicate,
but is there any other way to test builds on github/cryoem/eman2 ?

- automatic rerender strategy for pydusa-feedstock, eman-feedstock, ... ?

- update wiki for build system



- write tiff stacks
 - careful with image overwriting ???
 - metadata
 - ometiff

- ome-zarr
